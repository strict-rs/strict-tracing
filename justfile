# This justfile is the canonical repo entry point and command index for
# developers, AI agents, and local automation. Apart from the default listing
# recipe, recipes stay as thin dispatchers into the composed `cargo xtask`
# runner.
#
# Reusable workflow behavior lives in the owning external `strict-xtask-*`
# crates. Local `xtask/src/` is composition glue plus the `just x` extension
# seam, so automation remains compiled, linted, and tested as Rust instead of
# growing inside this file.
#
# Most repositories should add their own automation through the local extension
# registry and run it as `just x <name>`. Do not add repo-specific commands to
# the shared `strict-xtask-*` crates.
#
# Only reusable template-wide workflows belong in `strict-xtask-*`. When you are
# deliberately maintaining that shared surface, change the owning crate first,
# then expose the composed command with a one-line recipe here.
#
# `just --list` renders the contiguous comment immediately above each recipe.
# Keep recipe-adjacent comments to one short user-facing help sentence; put
# maintainer notes above a blank line so they do not leak into the command list.
