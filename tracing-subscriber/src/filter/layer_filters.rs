//! ## Per-Layer Filtering
//!
//! Per-layer filters permit individual `Layer`s to have their own filter
//! configurations without interfering with other `Layer`s.
//!
//! This module is not public; the public APIs defined in this module are
//! re-exported in the top-level `filter` module. Therefore, this documentation
//! primarily concerns the internal implementation details. For the user-facing
//! public API documentation, see the individual public types in this module, as
//! well as the, see the `Layer` trait documentation's [per-layer filtering
//! section]][1].
//!
//! ## How does per-layer filtering work?
//!
//! As described in the API documentation, the [`Filter`] trait defines a
//! filtering strategy for a per-layer filter. We expect there will be a variety
//! of implementations of [`Filter`], both in `tracing-subscriber` and in user
//! code.
//!
//! To actually *use* a [`Filter`] implementation, it is combined with a
//! [`Layer`] by the [`Filtered`] struct defined in this module. [`Filtered`]
//! implements [`Layer`] by calling into the wrapped [`Layer`], or not, based on
//! the filtering strategy. While there will be a variety of types that implement
//! [`Filter`], all actual *uses* of per-layer filtering will occur through the
//! [`Filtered`] struct. Therefore, most of the implementation details live
//! there.

///    whether they had previously disabled a given span, and avoid showing it
///    to the wrapped layer if it was disabled.
///
///    This allows `Filtered` layers to also filter out the spans they
///    disable from span traversals (such as iterating over parents, etc).
/// 2. If all the bits are set, then every per-layer filter has decided it
///    doesn't want to enable that span or event. In that case, the
///    `Registry`'s `enabled` method will return `false`, so that
